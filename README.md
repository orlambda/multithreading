Code written as I learn multithreading

This code is for my own learning, such as to follow a course or to test language features, rather than for a specific purpose.

I am starting by watching [Mike Shah's playlist on Modern C++ Concurrency](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvv0ScY6vfd_ocTP2ZLicgqKnvq50OCXM)
